### How to submit an ECR?

After deciding an ECR for the change is needed (attending to the CMP guidelines), you may prepare its submission following these steps:

1. In GitHub, under the Issues tab, click “New Issue” and select the ECR template.
2. Fill out the form using Markdown styling language. The form itself has indications commented out for helping its redaction. Checking the preview may also be useful.
*(Note: ECR ID# format is two-digit year/number. For example, if it is the 4th report of the year 2020, the ID# is 20/04).*
3. Once it has been filled, make sure you are not missing any information and send it. You may be able to modify it after sending, but once it has been registered by a CVM authority, newer modifications might not be considered.
4. As soon as possible, a CVM authority will have registered the issue. Once that person receives the application, he will post a comment in the issue indicating time and date of the reception.
5. After that, when a decision has been made (either approved or rejected), it will be notified to the requestor by commenting the issue on GitHub and closing it.
