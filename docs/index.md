#  The Drone Face - SARUS Project

## What is SARUS?

SARUS is a project made by The Drone Face. Its aim is to develop a complex system of coordinated drones that will perform Search and Rescue tasks in the mountains. It shall support rescue teams in order to save as much time as possible, thus, as many lives as possible.

## Features

The whole project can be divided into its four main modules which have been developed simultaneously.

### User Interface

- Designed to be user-friendly and flexible.
- Easy to manage the swarm:
  - Adding / Removing deployed drones.
  - Individually selecting and controlling drones.
  - Visualizing system warnings and drones' parameters (battery, position...).
- Hand-drawing the searching areas polygons.
- Powerful routes displaying.
- General system messages log.
- Simulated world displayed.

### Mission Planner
Integrated into the User Interface, given a polygon and swarm size, it will sort the drones into different areas.

### Computer Vision


### tdf_gazebo map
The Simulation Team at TDF has developed a brand new map for their simulation purposes. It features multiple environments to design and test the S&R tasks.
- Collapsed Buildings
- Forest
- Leafy forest
- Base to deploy S&R drones

As well, it features custom gazebo models for animals and people.
